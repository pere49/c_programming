1. Download codeblocks from References section. Ensure it is the mingw version i.e. packaged with the compiler :sunglasses:
2. Install the application, just proceed to next page, and ensure to select C if asked.
3. After installation is complete, pop-up may appear to allow to select compiler, look for **GNU GCC Compiler**
